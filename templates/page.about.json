            "itr-text": "<p>A new (but old) ingredient you most likely didn’t know you were missing. A rare and mysterious pepper from st. Augustine, Florida. Known for its signature “slow burn” and naturally sweet heat, it provides a subtle blend of fruity, tangy flavor with a gradual, tingly and lingering heat.<br\/><br\/>Despite mysterious origins, it has been a culinary staple and centerpiece of old Florida cuisine for 200+ years. We suspect the datil originated in the caribbean, and was brought to Florida in the late 1700’s\/early 1800’s, where it became a local treasure, and evolved over time into the unique pepper it is today. Our datil peppers are grown with care on a small (but growing) farm just outside St. Augustine.<\/p>",
